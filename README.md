# GlueyNotesPHP

(While cleaning up some archives, I found this very old code, and thought I'd put it up in case it somehow helped someone.)

GlueyNotes was a start up I was building around 2006. The main idea was a way to take text notes and have them sync to other devices. It was using a plain text format somewhat similar to org-mode, but much more simplistic. It was also supposed to allow teams to share these notes. I built a few clients for this - an Adobe Flash client, and an iOS client (both of which I can't find the code for sadly). 

I have not run this code in years so I have no idea if it's usable in it's current state. I believe it was based on my little [MVC PHP framework](https://github.com/robrohan/MvCphp).
